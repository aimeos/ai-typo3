The Aimeos web shop components can integrate into almost any PHP application and uses the infrastructure of the application for building URLs, caching content, configuration settings, logging messages, session handling, sending e-mails or handling translations.

The ai-typo3 extension integrates Aimeos into the TYPO3 CMS and utilizes the native TYPO3 components for content caching, sending mails, session handling and generating URLs.

If you are using the TYPO3 CMS, you don't have to install and set up the ai-typo3 extension yourself. Instead, use the [Aimeos TYPO3 package](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-typo3) to create a web shop within minutes.
